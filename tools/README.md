# Tools

A reproducible converter turning Hebrew New Testament manuscript PDFs into
OSIS, and the generators that build the data files Milah reads at run time.

Nothing here is needed to build or run [Milah](../README.md). The editor reads
this corpus but does not depend on the converter, and the two are developed
independently.

```

## Environment

All Python commands use the shared `tp` environment, created by
`tools\python\install_tp.bat` at `%USERPROFILE%\.venvs\tp`.

```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.venvs\tp\Scripts\python.exe" -m pip install --no-build-isolation -e ".[dev]"
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.venvs\tp\Scripts\python.exe" -m pytest --basetemp .pytest-tmp
```

Both run from the repository root: `pyproject.toml` lives there and points at
`tools/python`.

## PDF to OSIS

Convert one PDF:

```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.venvs\tp\Scripts\python.exe" -m pdf2osis convert `
  --book sloane_rev `
  --input "tools/data/00_source_files/A-Hebrew-Manuscript-of-the-Book-of-Revelation-British-Library-Sloane-273.pdf" `
  --output-dir tools/data/01_osis
```

Books are `rev`, `jas` and `mat` (Project Truth Ministries Cochin editions),
`sloane_rev` (British Library, Sloane MS 237) and `ebr530_luke` /
`ebr530_john` (Vatican, Vat. ebr. 530). `convert-all` converts every one:

```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.venvs\tp\Scripts\python.exe" -m pdf2osis convert-all `
  --source-dir tools/data/00_source_files `
  --output-dir tools/data/01_osis
```

Each conversion writes clean Hebrew, annotated Hebrew and annotated English
OSIS. The converter parses and validates every document before replacing any
existing output. Its JSON report lists coverage, empty and alternate verses,
note counts, excluded markers and source anomalies.

Output is named `<BOOK>_<Manuscript>_<variant>.osis` — book code first, then the
manuscript, as in `Rev_CochinOo.1.16.2_hebrew_commented.osis` or
`Luke_Ebr530_translation.osis`. `<BOOK>` is the OSIS book id — the same string
that names the book's `<div type="book" osisID="…">` and every verse inside it
(`Rev`, `Jas`, `Matt`, `Luke`, `John`, …), or `NT` for a source spanning the
whole New Testament in one file. This is *not* USFM: USFM's own 3-letter codes
are uppercase and fixed-width (`REV`, `JHN`), which is what the C++ app's own
`libraryFileName()`/`usfmCode()` (`app/src/core/books.cpp`) uses when *it*
names a file — a deliberate difference between the two tools, not an
oversight. `<variant>` is `hebrew`, `hebrew_commented` or `translation`. Every
filename derives from `BookProfile.stem`, so that field is the single place
the convention lives.

### Package layout

- `glyphs.py` — glyph-accurate decoding for PDFs whose ToUnicode CMap is wrong,
  resolving glyph IDs against each embedded font's own `cmap`
- `layout.py` — page geometry: column split, footnote separator detection,
  superscript and footnote-definition extraction
- `sloane.py` — extraction for British Library, Sloane MS 237
- `ebr530.py` — extraction for Vatican, Vat. ebr. 530 (Luke and John)
- `cochin.py` — one extractor per Cochin edition (`rev`, `jas`, `mat`)
- `osis.py` — OSIS construction: milestoned verses, attributed headers, and
  the indentation pass that gives one verse per line
- `validate.py`, `converter.py`, `profiles.py`, `models.py`

The CLI is the supported converter. `pdf2osis_cli.ipynb` is a thin interactive
wrapper around the same package; `03_pdf2osis_REV_sloane237.ipynb` drives the
Sloane 237 profile, `04_pdf2osis_LUK_JOH_ebr530.ipynb` the two Vatican ebr. 530
profiles, and `05_pdf2osis_cochin.ipynb` the three Cochin editions.

### Pointed manuscripts

MuPDF ≥1.26 already returns Hebrew in logical order, so nothing reverses it —
re-reversing, as the old notebooks did, roughly doubles the error rate. What
does need repair is the glyph mapping, and the two pointed manuscripts fail in
opposite ways:

| source | ToUnicode | embedded `cmap` | primitive |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sloane 237 | broken, ~12% of glyphs | present, correct | `get_texttrace` + font cmap |
| Vat. ebr. 530 | correct | **absent entirely** | `rawdict` glyph geometry |

Sloane 237's PDF embeds `David` as a Type0/Identity-H subset whose ToUnicode
CMap covers 30 of the ~170 glyph IDs in use and gets several wrong: sheva
decodes as dagesh, hiriq and qubuts as a shin dot, hataf segol as a space —
which is why a naive extraction produces more shin dots than shins. Its
embedded `cmap` is correct, so `pdf2osis.glyphs` resolves glyph IDs there.

Vat. ebr. 530's subsets have no `cmap` at all, and `get_texttrace` merges
adjacent runs — sometimes two whole printed lines — into one span, so reversing
a span swaps its runs. That profile reads `rawdict` and places each glyph by its
own coordinates. A combining mark is drawn at its base letter's left edge, so
attachment is exact; where two vowels overlap between neighbouring letters, the
rule that no letter takes the same point twice separates them.

`pdf2osis.layout` detects the footnote separator rule per page instead of
assuming a fixed y band; the rule moves between y=518 and y=621, and a fixed
band both dropped Revelation 1:18 and double-counted body text as footnotes.

### OSIS structure

All output uses milestoned `<chapter>` and `<verse>` so that material
belonging to no verse can sit in the flow:

- `<div type="introduction">` with a `<title type="main">` for the manuscript
  incipit, and `<div type="titlePage">` for the edition's title block
- `<title type="chapter">` for the gate heading dividing the two chapters
- `<milestone type="pb">` for the eight folio boundaries, at their true
  position — including mid-verse
- `<milestone type="x-ms-verse">` for divisions the manuscript numbers but the
  edition leaves unnumbered

Notes are `<note type="explanation" placement="foot">` with `osisRef` and
`osisID`, anchored at the offset where their superscript is printed.
`type="footnote"` is *not* a valid OSIS 2.1.1 note type, so nothing emits it.

Where a source states its own reference for a verse, it rides on
`subType="x-alt-…"` — Sloane's Hebrew letter-numerals, which disagree with the
printed numbering at Rev 1:9, 1:15, 1:16, 1:17 and 2:8, and Cochin's own
chapter and verse. OSIS requires such values to begin with `x-`, which is why
this is not a private-namespace attribute. The canonical reference stays in
`osisID`, and `n` carries the printed label — a range, such as `19-20`, where
one record covers two verses.

Every file validates against the upstream `osisCore.2.1.1.xsd`, vendored in
`tools/python/pdf2osis/schema/`, and is pretty-printed one verse per line.

### Coverage

| profile | records | extent |
|---|---|---|
| `rev` | 405 | Revelation 1:1–22:21, including the combined `14:19-20` record |
| `jas` | 107 | James 1:1–5:20; its `2:15` record covers KJV 2:15–16, so there is no independent `2:26` |
| `mat` | 646 | Matthew 1:1–19:30; the volume stops there |
| `sloane_rev` | 33 | Revelation 1:1–2:13 |
| `ebr530_luke` / `ebr530_john` | 35 / 13 | Luke 1:1–35, John 1:1–13 |
| `delitzsch` | 7959 | The whole New Testament, Matthew 1:1–Revelation 22:21, one file |
| `bsi_hnt` | 7959 | The whole New Testament, Matthew 1:1–Revelation 22:21, one file |

Revelation is **405**, arrived at from two corrections in opposite directions.
`Rev 2:26` (PDF page 54) and `Rev 20:12` (page 329) are in the source but their
headers are not set at the usual type size, so a size-keyed search missed them;
both were checked against the rendered pages. Against that, the second
`Revelation 2:21` header is not a verse at all — see below — so counting it gave
406.

#### Verses the manuscripts lack

Five references are printed with no text because the manuscript has none:
`Rev 2:6`, `2:28`, `9:9`, `16:11` and `Jas 1:21`. Each is emitted as a numbered,
empty verse carrying the edition's own notice — "This verse does not exist in
the Cochin Oo.1.16.2 manuscript" — as a `<note type="explanation">` with
`osisID="…!note.absent"`. Absence by design is therefore never mistaken for a
gap in extraction.

Detection is anchored to the start of a transcription, translation or `Note:`
field. The same words appear elsewhere meaning something else: `Rev 14:19-20`'s
note says "verse 20 does not exist" while the record itself holds verse 19, Matt
8:10 translates "there does not exist faith like this", and the KJV and Aramaic
comparison columns use the phrase for their own missing text.

#### Verses the manuscript transposes

Cochin Oo.1.16.2 swaps `Rev 2:21` and `2:22` — Cochin 2:20 = KJV 2:22, Cochin
2:21 = KJV 2:21 — and the edition follows the manuscript's order. It marks the
swap with a bare `Revelation 2:21` header on page 50 whose whole content is
"Note: The Cochin manuscript changes the order of the following verses"; the
verse itself is on page 51. That signpost is not a verse, and counting it split
2:21 into a spurious empty `21a` and a real `21b`. It now attaches to `Rev.2.21`
as a `…!note.order` note.

Both transposed verses carry `type="x-reordered"`, which is a separate
`attributeExtension` from the `subType` holding the Cochin reference, so the
flag survives into the `hebrew` variant that has no apparatus. They are the only
two out-of-order verses in the corpus; James and Matthew have none.

### Cochin extraction

The three Cochin PDFs share a house style but not a format, so each has its own
extractor in `pdf2osis/cochin.py`: Revelation is headed `Revelation N:V (Cochin
N:V)` and carries an interlinear gloss table, James is headed `James N:V (KJV …)`
with no such table, and Matthew is headed `Chapter C:V` and prints a Syriac
Aramaic column at the same type size as its English — so script, not size,
separates them.

Where the interlinear table repeats a transcription word at the same length and
differs in exactly one letter, the gloss wins: the two are set in different
subsets of one face and each resolves letters the other confuses (he read as
het, bet as kaf). Anything less clear-cut is left alone, because the
transcription is the authority on wording and order.

Output is pretty-printed one verse per line. lxml's `pretty_print` refuses to
reformat mixed content, which is exactly what milestone form produces, so
`pdf2osis.osis.indent_body` sets the tails by hand.

### Delitzsch Hebrew New Testament (SWORD module)

Not a PDF: `pdf2osis/sword.py` reads a CrossWire SWORD module directly with
`pysword`, which returns clean, already verse-segmented text — no glyph
decoding or page-layout detection applies here at all. The module's own
`Versification` declaration (NRSV) is the source of truth for how many
chapters and verses each book has.

This is a whole-Testament source — one translation across all 27 NT books —
so it produces **one file** covering the whole NT, not 27 per-book files:
`pdf2osis/osis.py`'s `build_multibook_osis` writes one `<div type="book">` per
book inside a single `osisText`, in canonical order (Matthew … Revelation).
`build_structured_osis` (every other, single-book profile) shares a
`_write_book` helper with it; only the wrapping around that shared per-book
logic differs.

Three verses across the whole NT — 2 Corinthians 13:14, 3 John 1:15,
Revelation 12:18 — are NRSV versification slots this module's text does not
fill. They are kept, numbered, empty, with the reason as a note.

There is no accompanying English text at all, so `BookProfile.has_translation
= False` suppresses the `translation` variant entirely, and the copyright and
translator credit — normally only on the translation variant, since that is
usually the only copyrightable modern text — move to the Hebrew variants
instead, since here they are the only place those facts have anywhere to go.

**Licensing**: the module is Streams in the Negev's 2003 transcription and
repointing of Delitzsch's 1885 translation, distributed by CrossWire
"free for use by any non-commercial project" — not public domain. The
`rights` field in `profiles.DELITZSCH` states this in the OSIS header itself.
The module zip is downloaded, not committed
(`tools/data/00_source_files/sword/`), and `tests/test_sword.py` skips if it
is not present locally.

### Modern Hebrew New Testament (scraped)

*HaBrit HaChadasha* (Bible Society in Israel, 1995, revised 2010) has no
digital edition, app or API the publisher offers directly — the only place
its text exists online is a third-party mirror, `nocr.net`, which prints it
one chapter at a time with no bulk export. `pdf2osis/bsi_hnt.py` therefore
splits into two steps that never touch the network at the same time:

- `fetch_bsi_nt()` walks all 27 books, chapter by chapter, until a chapter
  comes back with no Hebrew cell (there is no chapter count published
  anywhere to check against), and writes the result to a local JSON cache —
  a politeness delay is applied between requests, since this is a small,
  non-commercial mirror, not an API meant for bulk access.
- `extract_bsi_nt()` reads that cache. Conversion, including every test in
  `tests/test_bsi_hnt.py`, never re-scrapes the site.

Verse numbers are printed inline in each chapter's text ("1:1 … 1:2 …") with
no other delimiter, so splitting on that pattern is the only way to recover
individual verses; the split result is checked for strictly sequential verse
numbers, which is what would break if a verse's own text happened to contain
something that looked like a reference. The site's own combining-mark order
for Hebrew niqqud varies verse to verse for visually identical text, so
`_split_verses` normalises every verse to NFC — un-normalised, two "identical"
verses can fail `==` while rendering the same.

Structurally this mirrors Delitzsch exactly — one multi-book file via the same
`build_multibook_osis`, no `translation` variant, the same NRSV-shaped
versification (7959 verses total, matching Delitzsch's count, confirmed rather
than assumed). It is fully pointed with niqqud, unlike ordinary modern Hebrew
prose, though without Delitzsch's cantillation marks. Sixteen verses across
the NT are printed with no text — thirteen are the well-known verses modern
NT translations based on the earliest manuscripts omit or restructure (Matt
17:21, Mark 9:44, Acts 8:37, and others), and Romans 9:12 and 16:24 are
combined-verse cases where the source prints the reference with nothing
before the next one. All are kept, numbered, empty, with a note.

**Licensing**: unlike Delitzsch, there is **no license grant at all** — the
source states only "copyrighted (c) 1995, revised (c) 2010 by The Bible
Society in Israel," with no reuse or redistribution permission anywhere. The
`rights` field in `profiles.BSI_HNT` states this verbatim in the OSIS header.
The cache (`tools/data/00_source_files/bsi_hnt/`) and generated output are for
local use only — not committed, not redistributed, absent direct permission
from the publisher.

### Known issues

- The Cochin editions print no material outside their verses, so unlike the two
  manuscripts they carry no `<title>`, folio milestones or introduction div —
  there is nothing in the source to put there.
- The absence and order notices are attached as notes, so they appear only in
  the `hebrew_commented` and `translation` variants. The `x-reordered` flag is
  an attribute and appears in all of them.
- PyMuPDF must be ≥1.26, where MuPDF switched to returning text in logical
  order. Every extractor reads Hebrew on that assumption, so an older wheel
  reverses it silently rather than failing.

## Data-file generators

`tools/python/tools/` builds the files Milah reads from `app/data/` at run time.
They are run rarely and their output is committed, so a normal build never
needs them.

```powershell
python tools/python/tools/build_lexicon.py --strongs <…> --wlc <…> --tbesh <…> --out app/data/hebrew_lexicon.json
python tools/python/tools/build_wordlist.py --out app/data/rabbinic.words.txt
python tools/python/tools/build_roots.py
```

- `build_lexicon.py` — Strong's numbers and the inflected forms they appear as
- `build_wordlist.py` — rabbinic Hebrew vocabulary, refusing any Sefaria version
  that is not public domain, CC0 or CC-BY
- `build_roots.py` — the root index the suggestion checks consult

`build_lexicon.py` mirrors `comparisonKey()` from
[`app/src/core/tokenize.cpp`](../app/src/core/tokenize.cpp) character for
character; the two are a join key and must not drift.

**Sources, licences and what each file covers are documented in
[`app/data/README.md`](../app/data/README.md)** — including the attribution that
CC-BY requires and that travels with every build.
