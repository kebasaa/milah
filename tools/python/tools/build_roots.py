"""Derives a Strong's-number-to-root map from the shipped Hebrew lexicon.

Reads ``app/data/hebrew_lexicon.json`` -- the file Milah already ships -- and
writes ``app/data/hebrew_roots.json``. Nothing is downloaded, so this runs in
under a second and can be iterated on freely, unlike build_lexicon.py, which
needs three external corpora the repository does not carry.

The source is each entry's ``d`` (derivation) field, Strong's own etymology
prose::

    "H4428": {"l": "מֶלֶךְ", "d": "from H4427 (מָלַךְ);", ...}

so מלך "king" is recorded as coming from מלך "to reign". The alignment uses this
to recognise that two differently spelt words belong to one root.

Why this is deliberately timid
------------------------------

Relatedness shades off fast, and every extra step collapses more distant words
into one bucket -- where the aligner will happily put them in the same column.
אָדָם H120 "man" derives from H119 "to be red"; יְהוּדָה from ידה "to praise".
Following those to a fixed point would be *worse* than not following them at
all. So:

* only the first clause of the derivation is read, and only when it names
  exactly one number -- "from H430 and H1961" is a compound with no single root;
* "a primitive root" means the entry *is* a root and has no parent;
* chains are walked at most ``--max-hops`` steps, not to a fixed point;
* a root that ends up with more than ``--max-root-bucket`` members is dropped
  entirely, on the grounds that it has stopped naming anything useful;
* an entry that is its own root is omitted, since it tells the scorer nothing
  the Strong's number did not already.
